# Information:
This repository is up-to-date with the latest releases of the macro.
This means it will have the latest things im working on available for testing, however that does not mean releases are stable or work efficiently.
If anything is missing (e.g. issues as small as me forgetting to update the VersionID to a new version/the version I'm working on to as big as a completely busted function) or not working please create an issue thread in this repository.
Note: Commits may not have descriptions and no tags or releases will be created as there is no point in doing so except with more stable releases in the original repo [https://github.com/NegativeZero01/skibi-defense-macro]
